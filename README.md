# ParkOz

ParkOz is a web application made during the Accenture Tech Bootcamp and won second place overall.

ParkOz aims to reduce time users spend looking for parking, allowing users to access data on nearby parking spaces in real time. ParkOz also provides information on parking spaces, allowing users to filter and sort on different attributes such as nearby facilities.

This web application is an MVP of the full ParkOz application.
